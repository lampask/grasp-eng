            "text": "When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone, \"there are bitter weeds in England.\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.\nSo I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our Island Home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.\nAt any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation.\nThe British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.\nEven though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail.\nWe shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France,\nWe shall fight on the seas and oceans,\nWe shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be,\nWe shall fight on the beaches,\nWe shall fight on the landing grounds,\nWe shall fight in the fields and in the streets,\nWe shall fight in the hills;\nWe shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.",
